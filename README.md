***

Adds items that can be equipped (using the [Curios API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios)) to show the player's position and biome, to replace the F3 debug info. 
Items in curios slots can be rearranged to your liking, and the number of available gadget slots can be changed in config.

Config options also let you change the position of the gadget gui, and whether you need to have the gadgets equipped.

The biome icons are taken and adapted from [this file](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/5/59/BiomeCSS.png) from the Minecraft Wiki.

Supports custom biomes - just put an 18*18 icon in your mod/resource pack in `assets/gadgets/textures/gui/biome_icons/MOD_ID/BIOME_NAME.png`. 
The mod comes with icons for the biomes from: 

- [Abundance](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/abundance)
- [Atmospheric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atmospheric)
- [Autumnity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autumnity)
- [Bayou Blues](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bayou-blues)
- [The Endergetic Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endergetic)
- [Environmental](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/environmental)
- [Infernal Expansion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infernal-expansion)
- [The Outer End](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-outer-end) (icons by SirDurpsalot)
- [Terrestria Reforged](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria-reforged) (icons by SirDurpsalot) (WIP)


*NOTE: if an update adds a new gadget, you may want to increase the config option for number of curio slots, as the default is the number of gadgets and the file won't update between versions.*
